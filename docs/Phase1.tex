    \section{Introduction}
    This section will discuss generic and detailed information about \mtg tournaments. The following definitions will be utilized later in the document.
    \subsection{Tournament Overview}
    \mtg tournaments are run as a multiple round Swiss tournament with a cut to a single elimination top 8. Pairing for each round is determined by player's current standings, where players with similar standings are paired to play against each other. At the end of a certain number of rounds, usually determined by the tournament's size, the top eight players by standing take part in a single-elimination finals bracket.

            \textbf{Terms} & \textbf{Definitions} \\
            \hline
            Game & A single play of the \mtg consisting of one or two players. A game is part of a \textit{Match}. A game results in a single winner.\\
            \hline
            Game Winner & A single player that is deemed to be the victor of the game.\\
            \hline
            Match & A series of games between at most two players. Matches will result in a winner or loser (in cases of a draw, no losers).\\
            \hline
            Match Pairing & A system to define the member(s) of the match. Match Pairings are calculated using the player's standings.\\
            \hline
            Match Score & The points given to the winner and loser, or in the case of a draw, both players.\\
            \hline
            Match Winner & The player that is first to win two games in a match. A match score of 3 is given to the player.\\
            \hline
            Match Loser & The player that was unable to win the match. A match score of 0 is given to the player.\\
            \hline
            Bye & A match with one player. The player is automatically declared the winner. A player can only play in one bye per tournament.\\
            \hline
            Round & A collection of matches. Rounds are defined as swiss or bracket.\\
            \hline
            Swiss Round & A subset of \textit{Round}. A Swiss Round is in which matches do not eliminate individuals from the proceeding rounds.\\
            \hline 
            Bracket Round& A subset of \textit{Round}. A Bracket Round is in which matches eliminate individuals from the proceeding rounds.\\
            \hline
            Tournament & A collection of rounds, declaring a single winner.\\
            \hline
            Player Standing & A measurement of a player's comparative score amongst other players in the current tournament.\\
